# Sign Up Form 

This repository contains a simple sign-up form webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input their first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password. It includes basic form validation to ensure that users enter required information correctly.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the sign-up form.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the sign-up form and its elements.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for form validation.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) is structured as follows:

- **Head Section**: Contains meta tags, viewport settings, and links to external CSS files.
- **Body Section**: Divided into two main sections:
  - **Left Side**: Displays the logo and some introductory text.
  - **Right Side**: Contains the sign-up form.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) styles the sign-up form and its elements. It includes styles for layout, typography, input fields, buttons, and error messages.

## JavaScript for Form Validation

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) includes event listeners for form input fields to perform validation checks. It ensures that users enter valid information in the required format for fields such as email, phone number, and password. Error messages are displayed dynamically to guide users in filling out the form correctly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the sign-up form.
3. Fill out the form fields with valid information.

## Note
