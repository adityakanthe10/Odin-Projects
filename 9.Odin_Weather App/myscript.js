// Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.

// Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
// Display the information on your webpage!
// Add any styling you like!
